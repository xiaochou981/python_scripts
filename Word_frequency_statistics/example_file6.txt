the furthest distance in the world

The furthest distance in the world  
Is not between life and death 
But when I stand in front of you 
Yet you don't know that I love you 
The furthest distance in the world 
Is not when I stand in front of you 
Yet you can't see my love 
But when undoubtedly knowing the love from both 
Yet cannot be together 
The furthest distance in the world
Is not being apart while being in love
But when painly cannot resist the yearning
Yet pretending you have never been in my heart
The furthest distance in the world
Is not when painly cannot resist the yearning
yet pretending you have never been in my heart
but using one's indifferent heart
To dig an uncrossable river
For the one who loves you
